Predicting the age and gender of a person

## Status

### deploy_prediction.py
* Not yet created

### classification.py
* Not yet created

## Disclaimer

I do NOT believe this type of prediction-system should be used for any system in production, considering the ethical problems of a program like this. However, building this would be a challenge and this is why I decided to try it, to improve on my own skills.

## Getting Started

* Download the dataset
* Adjust your config
* Build dataset using build_dataset.py
* Train and evaluate the model using train.py/test_accuracy.py (both age and gender, remember to change the config)
